    <p>Hi, my name is Isabel. The shortest way to introduce myself is to share with you my love for life. I love life. I love all the possibilities that I find in life, I love enjoying nature and getting to know animals and people.
        I love stories and exploring different means of storytelling, that's what brought me to interactive media, more specifically film brought me to interactive media.</p>
        After interacting with a series of interactive projects at that consisted of films within films, or simply differet ways of interacting with films all together, I decided to learn more about how to create this stories 
        digitally.
    <p>After diving straight into UX and UI, and loving it, I wanted to learn more about the building component and literaly create the spaces where people interact with the space and the elements involved. 
        I enrolled in this class and am understanding that coding is pretty much a linguistics lesson, and quite fun! </p>
